Tesseract Box Editor
====================

An editor for editing .box files created by Tesseract OCR in training mode.
It was written in Apple's new language, Swift.

Open a .box file, and the editor will open the corresponding
.tif file (same filename as the box file but with a "tif" extension).

Some features don't work:

1. Merge character boxes
2. Split
3. Insert new character box
